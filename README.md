A Juju charm deploying and managing [Penpot](https://penpot.app) on Kubernetes. Penpot is the
web-based open-source design tool that bridges the gap between designers and
developers.

<!--
This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Penpot,
such as scaling the number of instances, integration with external
authentication providers, access to S3 for redundant file storage and more. It
allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to
[Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes
offerings.
-->

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their
own Penpot deployment while keeping operations sumple, and gives them the
freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

<!--
For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Penpot simple and
straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
enterprise deployments.
